# Fmask

Fmask (Function of mask) is an automated algorithm for detecting clouds and cloud shadows in Landsat 4-9 and Sentinel-2. The version later on 5.0 integrates advanced physical rules with machine learning techniques to generate accurate and reliable results.

## Getting Started
We are working on detailed installation and usage instructions, which will be available soon.

## Complete Package
You can download the compelete Fmask packages, including all historical versions, from [the fmask Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LIpHfPSS04reIjKnajniX9xCeVbycW3N?usp=sharing).

## Version History
### v5.0.0
The initial release of Fmask 5.

## Contributing
We welcome and encourage contributions to Fmask! There are two primary ways to contribute:

### Report Issues or Suggestions
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving Fmask, we encourage you to open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Share Problematic Images
We are actively collecting examples of images that have not been processed accurately by the current version of Fmask. If you come across such images, please share the image ID with us via this Google Sheet. The collected images will be used to refine the inner machine learning models, improving their accuracy and reliability in future versions.
